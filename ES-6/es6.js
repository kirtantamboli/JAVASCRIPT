//ES6
//Javascript ES6 has been around for a few years now, and it allows us to write code in a clever way which basically makes the code more modern and more readable. 
//It’s fair to say that with the use of ES6 features we write less and do more, hence the term ‘write less, do more’ definitely suits ES6.
